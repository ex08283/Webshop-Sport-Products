        <h2>YELLOW BABOON</h2>
        <p>
            The yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus) is a baboon in the family of Old World monkeys.
            The species epithet means "dog-head" in Greek, due to the dog-like shape of the muzzle and head. Yellow baboons have slim bodies with long arms and legs, and yellowish-brown hair.
